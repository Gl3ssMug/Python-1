## Moore-Mealy Coversion

#### About Moore Machine
>In the theory of computation, a Moore machine is a finite-state machine whose output values are determined only by its current state. This is in contrast to a Mealy machine, whose output values are determined both by its current state and by the values of its inputs.


#### About Mealy Machine
>In the theory of computation, a Mealy machine is a finite-state machine whose output values are determined both by its current state and the current inputs. (This is in contrast to a Moore machine, whose output values are determined solely by its current state.) A Mealy machine is a deterministic finite-state transducer: for each state and input, at most one transition is possible
