In this directory you will get programs on:
1. [Dictonary](https://github.com/bharatmazire/Python/tree/master/Programs/Basic/Dictonary)
> Dictionaries are sometimes found in other languages as “associative memories” or “associative arrays”. Unlike sequences, which are indexed by a range of numbers, dictionaries are indexed by keys, which can be any immutable type; strings and numbers can always be keys.

2. [File Handling](https://github.com/bharatmazire/Python/tree/master/Programs/Basic/FileHandling)
> In this directory you will get some programs which help to understang *how to do file IO in python ?*. This are very basic and simpel, but it will help.

3. [List](https://github.com/bharatmazire/Python/tree/master/Programs/Basic/List)
> In python, lists are part of the standard language. You will find them everywhere. Like almost everything in Python, lists are objects.

4. [Numbers](https://github.com/bharatmazire/Python/tree/master/Programs/Basic/Number)
> Here you will find some neumaric related programs

5. [Object Oriented Program](https://github.com/bharatmazire/Python/tree/master/Programs/Basic/ObjectOrientedProgramming)
> This directory contain some python programs to understand *"how we can use python in oop way ?"*
